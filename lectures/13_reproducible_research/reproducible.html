# Today's Class

### Reproducible Research
  - #### Motivation
  - #### What is it?
  - #### Why is it important?
  - #### How to do it?

### Midterm logistics

### Reality of Scholarly Communication
&lt;img src="img/scholarly_communication.jpeg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Scholarly communication

#### Traditional modes of communication of analytical results are:

  - Manuscripts
  - Reports
  - Presentations
  - Posters
  - Websites
  - Dashboards

---

# Purpose of scholarly communication

  - #### To report what youâ€™ve **actually** discovered, **clearly enough** that **someone else can discover it for themselves**.
  
    - #### To make it easier for readers to understand what you did
  
    - #### ***To make it easier for readers to replicate/reproduce what you did***

---

# However....

#### Modern statistical software = "blackbox"

--

### Readers are supposed to focus on the final results

  - *and not the code that derived it*

### Reproducibility crisis in science

#### Intentional mistakes

### Reproducibility crisis in science

#### Unintentional mistakes

### Influence on the public

&lt;img src="img/this_american_life.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
### Researchers (including you and me) are fallible too

&lt;img src="img/bias_reproducibility.jpeg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Reproducible Research

- #### Original data and (computer code) can be re-analyzed by an independent investigator to obtain the same results

  - #### The analysis can be successfully repeated
  
  - #### Highly important in studies where computational analysis plays a large role

---
# Reproducible Research

- #### Expose more of the research workfow to our audience

  - Easier for them to make a more informed assessment of our methods and results
  
  - Easier for them to adapt our methods to their own research

---
# Reproducible Research

---
# Reproducible Research

- Science moves forward when discoveries are **replicated** and **reproduced**

  - Many important scientific advancements have been incremental
  
  - Verifiability and reproducibility are among the cornerstones of the scientific process. 
  
  - They allow scientists to **"stand on the shoulder of giants".**
  
  - incremental + incremental + incremental .... ..... + incremental = *"Nobel Prize"*

---
### Replicable vs Reproducible

#### Replicable Research

  - If you *collected new data* and *performed the experiment again* or *answered the same question*, would you receive consistent results?
  
  - independent investigators use methods, protocols, data, and equipment to confirm scientific claims.
  
  - Often expensive, and tough to do as new settings can induce errors or differences
  
  - Replicable research is reproducible
---
### Replicable vs Reproducible Vs Correct Research

#### Reproducible Research

  - when data sets and computer code are made available for researchers to verify results
  
  - If you ran analysis on the same data using the same set of methods that the researcher specified, would you receive same results?
  
  - A study is reproducible if there is a specific set of computational functions/analyses (usually specified in terms of code) that exactly reproduce all of the numbers in a *published* paper from *raw* data
  
  - *Reproducible* is not necessarily *replicable*
  
  - *Reproducible/replicable* is not necessarily *correct*
  
    - The study could be poorly designed or executed but still be reproducible or replicable

---
# Why should I care?

- Avoid embarrassment

- Save time, in the long run

- Improves your mental health ! ! ! (ask me)

-  Show evidence of correctness
  - Allows for independent evaluation
  
- Greater potential for extension impact for your work
  - Others can build on your work/methods
  - You can build on your prior work

&gt; ### Your closest collaborator is you six months ago,
but you don't reply to emails.

---
# What could go wrong?

- "The attached is similar to the code we used."
- "Where did this data file come from?!"
- "Can you repeat the analysis, omitting subject X?"
- "This part of your script is now giving an error."

### How to perform do reproducible research?

---
class: middle, inverse, center

### Good News!

--

### You already doing some of it

---
# Bad News

  - Importance is widely recognized, but not widely practiced

--

  - More start up time

--  

  - Not sent up for instant gratificiation

--

  - Takes a different mindset (Challenges our biases and in some cases, EGO!)

--
### However
- Will be outweighed by time saved later
- You can go back in time and fix errors with confidence
- Becomes easier with practice

---
# Basic Principles

  - Everything via code
  - Everything automated
  - Workflow and dependencies clearly documented
  - Get the data in the most-raw form possible
  - Get any/all data and meta-data possible
  - Keep track of the provenance of all data files
  - *Be self-sufficient

---
### Four facets of reproducibility

  - *Documentation*
    - Use markdown to document your workflow so that anyone can pick up your data and follow what you are doing
    - Use *literate programming* so that your analysis and your results are tightly connected, or better yet, unseperable

  - *Organization*
    - tools to organize your projects so that you don't have a single folder with hundreds of files

  - *Automation*
    - the power of scripting to create automated data analyses

  - *Dissemination*
    - publishing is not the end of your analysis, but paves way for future research.

&gt; ## YOU ARE ALREADY DOING ALL OF THIS

---
# Is this reproducible ?

- Open a an excile file to extract as CSV

--

- Open a csv file in word and delete first blank row

--

- Save your graph from R on your desktop and paste it in your markdown file

--

- Manually type in numbers/results in your Rmarkdown Document


--

- Submit your final project in word, and Paste results into the text 

---

## In future labs/assignments

- We will practice and assess how reproducible our analysis is

&gt; ### MID-TERMS LOGISTICS

---
# Midterm Exam Structure

- Multiple choice, True and False, fill in the blanks, short answers
- Focus on both theory and programming skills
- Covers all material till (including) today.
- Lectures, labs, readings, data camp
- Distributed Thursday morning
- Take exam by March 4, 11:59 pm.
- You can study together, but no collaboration while taking exam
- Piazza will be paused during exam time

---
# Your resources

- Class materials (lectures, labs, readings, piazza, data camp)

- Your TA, me (for clarifying questions)

- Practice Questions (w answers)
  - We will go through some in class on Wednesday and some for you to practice on your own

# Examples

# Answer Qs based on screenshots:

&lt;img src="img/screenshot1.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- How many attributes, and features are there?
- Is this a projected system ? True of False
- What does each observation represent?

---
# Answer Qs based on code:


```r
colnames(nc_wide)
```

```
 [1] "geoid"            "name"             "white"            "black"           
 [5] "native_americans" "hispanic"         "poc"              "white_majority"  
 [9] "total_population" "med_hh_income"   
```

```r
newdat &lt;- nc_wide %&gt;% select(geoid:black, ends_with("n"))
```

#### Based on this code: what will be the dimensions of newdat ?

---
# Output type 1


```r
x &lt;- c(1:6,5,NA,NA,10,5)
which(x &gt;=5)
```

What will be the output?

  a. An error
  
  b. logical vector with 7 elements
  
  c. logical vector with 11 elements
  
  d. NA
  
  e. numerical vector with 7 elements
  
  f.numerical vector with 5 elements

---

---
# Output type 2


```r
