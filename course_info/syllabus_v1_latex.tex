\hypertarget{course-description}{%
\section{COURSE DESCRIPTION}\label{course-description}}

This course will introduce you to data science with a focus on spatial
(geographic) data, which are data that are referenced to a particular
location on Earth's surface. You will learn concepts, techniques, and
tools you need to apply various facets of data science practice,
including data collection, management, and integration, descriptive
modeling, exploratory spatial data analysis, and effective communication
via data visualization and mapping. Real world examples and datasets
spanning physical, social, and health sciences will be used throughout
the course in an effort to promote contextual learning.

\hypertarget{course-objectives}{%
\section{COURSE OBJECTIVES}\label{course-objectives}}

The overall objective of this course is to introduce you to the core
concepts, tools and intuition required to be a succesful and responsible
spatial data scientist. This course is much more about ``learning to
learn'' and problem solving rather than acquiring specific programming
tricks or stats wizardry.

By the end of the semester you should be able to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Pull down publicly available datasets from non-conventional data
  sources within R (no more pointing and clicking on the numerous
  weblinks)
\item
  Quickly and efficiently organize, clean, and visualize spatial
  datasets programmatically using tidydata principles
\item
  Describe and interpret interesting spatial patterns in data
\item
  Critically evaluate and choose appropriate Exploratory Spatial Data
  Analysis to analyze data
\item
  Write and communicate your results in a scientific and reproducible
  manner using a
  \href{http://ross.net/funnelweb/tutorial/intro_what.html}{literate
  programming} language such as Mardown
\item
  Answer useful research questions by applying the tools and principles
  of spatial data science to a real world dataset with an
  inter-disciplinary team
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{course-structure}{%
\section{COURSE STRUCTURE}\label{course-structure}}

To help you achieve the course objectives, we will primarily engage in
active learning through numerous in-class activites and labs. You will
be provided with readings and interactive modules to complete
\emph{before class} so that most of the class time can be used for
discussion and hands-on activites instead of passive lecturing.
Similarly, the homeworks, exams and the final project are aimed to help
you solidify your understanding of the material and apply tools and
principles learned in class. The main purpose of having these numerous
\emph{checks} is not to test you on what is right or wrong, but to help
you think creatively and provide you with a platform to express your
creativity. Since you will spend majority of the class programming in R,
I hope that you consider programming as a medium (and an important skill
for the job market) that enables you to be creative, but in a
scientifically sound, transparent and meaningful manner.

Programming is a skill that is best learnt by doing, and programming
languages, like any other language, are best learnt through practice,
practice and practice. As such, the best way to learn R or any language
is to fully commit to the language and do everything you can to practice
it most days of the week for at least half an hour, and ideally more.
Other than the materials covered in class, you can hone your R skills by
writing other class homeworks in RMarkdown, creating a personal website
in R, making presentations in R, or even sending emails through R. The
main idea is to immerse yourself into the language, learn how to ask for
help, and continuously practice what you learn. Although coding, just
like any other language can seem frustrating at the beginning, I promise
that this immersive approach will help in the short and long run. As
your instructor, I will facilitate your immersion as much as possible
through a variety of class activites and assignments. While I will
introduce you to new tools and techniques, it is up to you to take them
and make use of them.

The course is divided into the following \emph{five} components:

\hypertarget{classroom-participation-and-discussion-15}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Classroom participation and discussion
\emph{(15\%)}}{Classroom participation and discussion (15\%)}}\label{classroom-participation-and-discussion-15}}

Class sessions will include a mixture of lecture, discussion, and
applied activities (conducted both individually and in small groups).
All students are expected to not only attend class, but also be active
participants. In addition to the classroom, we will be using
\textbf{Piazza} for class discussion. Piazza is a widely used class
discussion platform to assist you with getting help efficiently from
(and providing help to) your classmates, the teaching assistant and
myself. Rather than emailing questions to me, I encourage you to first
post your questions on Piazza. Find our class page at:
\url{https://piazza.com/unc/spring2020/geog215/home} Class participation
and discussion will be graded on \emph{both presence and active
participation in the class and on piazza}.

\hypertarget{labs-20}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Labs
\emph{(20\%)}}{Labs (20\%)}}\label{labs-20}}

The objective of the labs is to give you hands on experience with data
analysis using modern statistical software. The labs will also provide
you with tools that you will need to complete the project successfully.
All labs must be submitted electronically through \emph{Sakai} by the
\textbf{start} of class on the due date as indicated in the schedule
below. The lab with lowest score for each student will be dropped.

\hypertarget{homeworks-15}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Homeworks
\emph{(15\%)}}{Homeworks (15\%)}}\label{homeworks-15}}

Beyond the in-class activities and labs, you will be given two larger
data analysis tasks during the semester. The purpose of these homeworks
is to combine different skills introduced in the labs to conduct an
integrated data analysis. All assignments must be submitted
electronically through \emph{Sakai} by the \textbf{start} of class on
the due date as indicated in the schedule below.

\hypertarget{exams-30}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Exams
\emph{(30\%)}}{Exams (30\%)}}\label{exams-30}}

There will be 2 exams during the semester. Each exam will require you to
complete a number of small programming and/or analysis tasks related to
the material presented in the class. The exams will be take home, and
each exam will be written to take between 3-5 hours. The exams are to be
completed individually and you are not allowed to talk about exam
content to other students in the class. The exact structure and content
of the exams will be discussed in more detail before they are assigned.

\hypertarget{final-project-20}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Final project
\emph{(20\%)}}{Final project (20\%)}}\label{final-project-20}}

You will complete a final project for this course, the goal of which is
to tackle an interesting problem using the tools and techniques covered
in this class. This project will be completed in teams assigned by me to
ensure a good balance of skills. Additional details on the project will
be provided as the course progresses. To assist you with your project,
you will work with a Graduate Research Consultant, Kate Brandt. The GRC
Program is sponsored by the Office for Undergraduate Research
(\url{http://our.unc.edu}), and you may be able to use this
research-exposure course to meet a requirement of the Carolina Research
Scholars Program (\url{http://our.unc.edu/students/crsp}). I encourage
you to visit the OUR website to learn about how you might engage in
research, scholarship and creative performance while you are at
Carolina.

\hypertarget{grading-criteria}{%
\subsection{Grading Criteria}\label{grading-criteria}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Class participation: \textbf{15\%}
\item
  Labs: \textbf{20\%}
\item
  Homeworks: \textbf{15}
\item
  Exams: \textbf{30\%}
\item
  Final project: \textbf{20\%}
\end{itemize}

Grades will be based on the following low cutoff values, although I
reserve the right to modify the exact values: \textbf{A} \emph{(93\%)},
\textbf{A-} \emph{(90\%)}, \textbf{B+} \emph{(87\%)}, \textbf{B}
\emph{(83\%)}, \textbf{B-} \emph{(80\%)}, \textbf{C+} \emph{(77\%)},
\textbf{C} \emph{(73\%)}, \textbf{C-} \emph{(70\%)}, \textbf{D}
\emph{(60\%)}, anything below \emph{60\%} is an \textbf{F}

\hypertarget{required-text}{%
\subsection{Required Text}\label{required-text}}

The course has no required text. We will read chapters and articles that
are freely available online. There will be roughly 1-3 readings per
week, which will be posted on the course website and in Sakai. The
expectation for readings is that you will be able to summarize and
discuss the main points/topics/ideas, as well as to identify interesting
or important aspects of each as they pertain to your personal interests
or the broader course material.

\hypertarget{prerequisites}{%
\subsection{Prerequisites}\label{prerequisites}}

There is no prerequisite for this course. However, some familiarity with
spatial data, basic statistics, computation, and/or coding is
recommended.

\hypertarget{class-resources}{%
\subsection{Class Resources}\label{class-resources}}

All lectures, notes, readings and other resources will be posted both on
the \href{geog215-spds.rbind.io}{course website} and on Sakai. We will
use sakai for assignment submissions and grading.

\hypertarget{computers-and-software}{%
\subsection{Computers and Software}\label{computers-and-software}}

In the course, we will be working with the programming language, R. R is
an open-source programming language and software environment widely used
in both industry (high employable) and academia. It can run on both
Windows and Mac OS. A software document will be provided to assist you
with getting set up with R. Computers should be brought to class
\emph{everyday} to complete in-class activities and demonstrations.

\hypertarget{class-policies}{%
\section{CLASS POLICIES}\label{class-policies}}

\hypertarget{classroom-expectations}{%
\subsection{Classroom Expectations}\label{classroom-expectations}}

I encourage healthy, constructive discussion of the topics and course
material. I operate under the assumption and requirement that everyone
will be respectful of their fellow classmates in this endeavor. Unless
your absence is university approved, I expect you to attend and actively
participate in class; frequent absences or tardiness will be considered
a legitimate cause for grade reduction. All of you bring your own unique
skills and viewpoints to this class. I expect you to both learn from,
and help your classmates by being active participants in the classroom
and on piazza.

\textbf{Note on class attendence policy:} In general, you are not
permitted to be absent from any class except for these University
Approved Absences: - Authorized University activities -
Disability/religious observance/pregnancy, as required by law and
approved by Accessibility Resources and Service and/or the Equal
Opportunity and Compliance Office (EOC) - Significant health condition
and/or personal/family emergency as approved by the Office of the Dean
of Students, Gender Violence Service Coordinators, and/or the Equal
Opportunity and Compliance Office (EOC).

For situations when an absence is not University approved or fall under
the above mentioned criteria (e.g., a job interview or club activity),
please \textbf{communicate with me early} about potential absences.
Please be aware that you are bound by the Honor Code when making a
request for a University approved absence.

\hypertarget{diversity-statement}{%
\subsection{Diversity Statement}\label{diversity-statement}}

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and
perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning
needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that
the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and
benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are
respectful of diversity: race, gender identity, national origin,
ethnicity, religion, social class, age, sexual orientation, political
background, and physical and learning ability. Your suggestions are
encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the
effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or
student groups.

Furthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my
students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and
experiences, and honors your identities (including gender identity,
sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race,
nationality, religion, and culture.) To help accomplish this:

-- If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that
appear in your official university records, please let me know.

-- If you feel like your performance in class is impacted by your
experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to talk with me. I
want to be a resource for you. I have completed both the Safe Zone and
Mental Health First Aid trainings, and while I may not be able to
directly help you, I can help you find and reach those that can help.

-- If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your
academic dean is an excellent resource.

-- I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about
diverse perspectives and identities. If something is said in class (by
anyone) that makes you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.

\hypertarget{late-submissions}{%
\subsection{Late submissions}\label{late-submissions}}

All assignments (labs,homeworks,exams,projects) will be posted on the
course website and on Sakai with detailed instructions. All assignments
must be submitted electronically prior to the due date/time. Late
submissions will be penalized 20\% for each day late. Late submissions
will only go unpenalized for documented medical reasons or by previous
agreement with the instructor.

\hypertarget{changing-grades}{%
\subsection{Changing Grades}\label{changing-grades}}

Out of fairness, grades will not be changed unless I have made a data
entry or arithmetic error.If I have made an error, please send me an
email with an explanation of the error within 24 hours of grades being
posted and I will check.

\hypertarget{academic-integrity}{%
\subsection{Academic Integrity}\label{academic-integrity}}

No grade is important enough to justify academic misconduct. UNC-CH has
an Honor Code with clear guidelines regarding academic integrity. Three
fundamental and rather simple principles to follow at all times are
that: (1) all work submitted be your own; (2) when using the work or
ideas of others, including fellow students, give full credit through
accurate citations; and (3) if you are uncertain about the rules on a
particular assignment, ask for clarification.

\textbf{A note on sharing / reusing code:} I am well aware that a huge
volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems.
Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something the course's policy is
that you may make use of any online resources (e.g.~StackOverflow) but
you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use
(or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not
explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. On individual
assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this
class. Except for the take home exams, you are welcome to discuss the
problems together and ask for advice, but you may not send or make use
of code from another team. On the take home exams all communication with
classmates is explicitly forbidden.

\hypertarget{professional-conduct}{%
\subsection{Professional Conduct}\label{professional-conduct}}

Students are expected to treat one another with the utmost respect at
all times. Disrespectful behavior toward other students or
instructors/TAs will not be tolerated and will result in disciplinary
action and significant grade penalties of at least 2/3 of a letter grade
off the student's final course grade. (If final course grades have
already been submitted to the Registrar, any grade penalties associated
with disrespectful of unprofessional conduct will be counted as
arithmetic errors that occurred during the semester and submitted as
amendments to the student's transcript.)
