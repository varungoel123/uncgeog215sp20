# Install Xaringan First

Install the **xaringan** package from [Github](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan):

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("yihui/xaringan")
```


You are recommended to use the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), but you do not have to.

- Create a new R Markdown document from the menu `File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Template -> Ninja Presentation`;<sup>1</sup>
- Click the `Knit` button to compile it.

# You can do this to your slides if you want
## Add `class: center, middle` to the start of your slide.
### Perhaps you want the appearance of a secondary title slide, which is what this will do.

# Sheena Easton and Total Conflict

Sheena Easton describes the following scenario for her baby:

- Takes the morning train
- Works from nine 'til five
- Takes another train home again
- Finds Sheena Easton waiting for him

--

Sheena Easton and her baby are playing a **zero-sum (total conflict)** game.

- Akin to Holmes-Moriarty game (see: von Neumann and Morgenstern), or "matching pennies."
- Useful for modeling strategic counterterrorism dilemmas between a government and terrorist group.

# A Total Conflict Between Sheena Easton and Her Baby

|                         | Sheena Easton Stays Home       | Sheena Easton Goes to Baby's Work |
|-------------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Baby Home Again**          |  -100, **100**         |  **100**, 0       |
| **Baby Stays at Work**             |   **50**, 0        |  -100, **100**        |

--

<br />

Notice we have no pure strategies, and no Nash equilibrium.

- Sheena Easton wants to proverbially "match pennies."
- Her baby has diametrically opposed preferences, fearing for his safety.

Solution: mixed strategy.

# Congressman Astley's Re-election Platform

Assume Congressman Astley presides over a competitive district in which he seeks reappointment. He promises he's:

- Never gonna give you up.
- Never gonna let you down.
- Never gonna run around and desert you.
- Never gonna make you cry.
- Never gonna say goodbye.
- Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.

Are these promises (if credible) sufficient to secure re-election?

# Caribbean Queen and Operation Urgent Fury

.pull-left[

Billy Ocean released "Caribbean Queen" in 1984.

- Emphasized sharing the same dream
- Hearts beating as one

"Caribbean Queen" is about the poor execution of Operation Urgent Fury.

- Coordination problems plagued its execution from the start.
- Echoed JCS chairman David Jones' frustrations with military establishment.
]

.pull-right[

![](http://wearethemighty.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GrenadaNewsCartoon.jpg)

*This seriously happened, btw..*
]

Billy Ocean is advocating for what became the Goldwater-Nichols Act.

- Wanted to take advantage of **economies of scale**, resolve **coordination problems** in U.S. military.

# The Good Day Hypothesis

We know the following about Ice Cube's day.

1. The Lakers beat the Supersonics.
2. No helicopter looked for a murder.
3. Consumed Fatburger at 2 a.m.
4. Goodyear blimp: "Ice Cube's a pimp."

--

This leads to two different hypotheses:

- $H_0$: Ice Cube's day is statistically indistinguishable from a typical day.
- $H_1$: Ice Cube is having a good day.

These hypotheses are tested using archival data from Ice Cube's life to estimate an item response model of the "goodness" of Ice Cube's days.

interval2 <- -qnorm((1-0.95)/2) # 95% multiplier

tribble(
  ~variable, ~est, ~se,
  "Latent Estimate of\nIce Cube's Day", 1.6, .231
) %>%
  ggplot(.) + theme_steve_web() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = .5, color = "red", lty=2) +
  geom_linerange(aes(x = variable, ymin = est - se*interval1,
                                ymax = est + se*interval1),
                            lwd = 1, position = position_dodge(width = 1/2)) +

                             lwd = 1/2, position = position_dodge(width = 1/2),

# You Can Do Other Stuff in Xaringan Too
## POSC 0000 -- It Would Be Cool If This Were an Actual Class Presentation
### I might use it mostly for the ability to put GIFs in class presentations, but it's flexible enough to do almost anything.

Show some R code and execute it if you'd like.

```{r}
pi

3+5

rnorm(10)

```

Here's a simple ultimatum game, a la Fearon (1995). Done via `DiagrammeR`.

```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
library(DiagrammeR)
grViz(" 
  digraph {
    # Multiple level nodes
    node [shape = square, color=CornflowerBlue]
    A [label = 'A']; 
    0 [label = '0', shape = none];
    B [label = 'B'];
    1 [label = '1', shape = none];
    Accept [label = '1 - x, x', shape = none];
    N;
    Awins [shape = none, label = '1 - k, k'];
    Bwins [shape = none, label = '-k, 1 - k']



     # Connect nodes with edges and labels
    A -> 0 [arrowhead= none]
    A -> B
    A -> 1 [arrowhead = none]
    B -> Accept [headlabel = 'Accept', labeldistance = 5, labelangle=75] 
    B -> N [label = '       Reject']
    N -> Awins [headlabel = 'A wins (1 - p)', labeldistance=4.5 ,
        labelangle=75]
    N -> Bwins [label = 'B wins (p)']
  }

[1]: 'A' 
[2]: '0'
[3]: paste0('Model 3\\n Split 3') 
[4]: paste0('Model 6\\n Split 4') 
")

```

# Conclusion

Xaringan is a nifty Rstudio add-on/package for creating HTML presentations.

- I think I'm still more inclined toward Beamer but Xaringan has tons of flexibility.
- Have an interactive component to your presentation (e.g. `leaflet` or a Shiny app)? You probably want Xaringan.

Plus, you can put GIFs into your presentation with Xaringan. That's nifty. Maybe students will like that.
